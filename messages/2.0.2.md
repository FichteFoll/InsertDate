v2.0.2 (2015-09-15)
-------------------

- Improved usability with `save_on_focus_lost` and
  `trim_trailing_white_space_on_save` settings (#26)

Important notice for Windows users:

    A bug in InsertDate together with a bug in Package Control prevented
    InsertDate 1.0.1 from being removed or updated conventionally. If
    InsertDate stopped working for you or you received an update message every
    time you restarted Sublime Text, make sure you update Package Control to
    3.1 and restart Sublime Text when asked to.
