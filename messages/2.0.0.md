v2.0.0 (2015-08-21)
-------------------

- Ask user to select a timezone from a quick panel on installation. This will
  also happen for updates if the user hasn't set one earlier
- `prompt` parameter from `insert_date` command has been extracted into a new command, named `insert_date_prompt`
- The prompt now inserts the default format if none was provided via parameter
  and auto-selects the pre-inserted text
- The prompt now also asks for an output timezone and will use the default
  (i.e. local) if you close the panel without making a selection
- Now uses pytz module via Package Control dependencies, where it can be
  updated independently. This makes manual installation inapplicable
- Fixed package improperly disabling on ST3 (#23)
- Fixed "settings changed" being displays on every plugin load
