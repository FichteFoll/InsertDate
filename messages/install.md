InsertDate
==========

Inserts the current date and/or time according to the specified format,
supporting named timezones.


Key Bindings (and Examples)
---------------------------

Open the Command Palette and select
"Preferences: InsertDate Keybindings - Default".


Settings
--------

Run "Preferences: InsertDate Settings - Default" for an overview of available
settings.

You should have been asked to set your "tz_in" timezone setting so that
InsertDate knows what your current timezone is and can represent it properly
when using `%Z`. It will also be used when translating timestamps to different
timezones, although this should work out of the box.
